# PromptAmbiguityDataset

**PromptAmbiguityDataset** is a collection of ambiguous natural language prompts designed to evaluate and improve prompt disambiguation techniques in AI systems. It spans multiple domains, including **coding, data analysis, and creative writing**, with annotated ambiguities and their corresponding refinements. This dataset supports research on **prompt engineering, iterative clarification, and language model interpretability**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Diverse Domains**: Covers coding, data analysis, and creative writing.
- **Annotated Ambiguities**: Each prompt includes identified ambiguities and clarifications.
- **Benchmarking & Research**: Useful for evaluating prompt disambiguation techniques in AI models.

## ðŸ“œ How to Cite
If you use this dataset in your research, please cite the following work:

> **F. Marozzo**, "Iterative Resolution of Prompt Ambiguities Using a Progressive Cutting-Search Approach," 2025.
